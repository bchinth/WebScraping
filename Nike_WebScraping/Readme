Nike Unisex Footwear Trends: A Web Scraping Data Analysis

In an advanced analysis initiative, I utilized sophisticated web scraping techniques like Selenium and Beautiful Soap to collect and categorize data on Nike's unisex footwear into sale and non-sale segments.
Utilizing a structured MySQL database, we applied meticulous data manipulation, wrangling and modeling to craft a high-quality dataset. 

This dataset then served as the foundation for a Machine Learning (ML) project aimed at uncovering common themes within Nike product descriptions through an unsupervised ML model that
